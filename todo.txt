      19/01/2020 - END - Divided Kreoh into 2 apps, one for main app w/ dashboard etc, second hosting user apps. IO think this is the way to go.

      Implemented the first Social media bar with working links etc, looks nice.

      Ive turned to page 2 of the home page templates, looks dreadful, needs redesign. I believe Home pages are finished for the MVP, moving onto secondary and tertiary pages.
